An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world.

Had some trouble with the exceeds expectations requirement of adding buttons to navigate through modal windows. The roadblock was getting data types mixed up ('0' compared to 0) but got through it in the end.

The styling changes I chose to use for the exceeds expectations grade were:
  Generate a random background color for each modal window.
  Scale the profile cards on hover and add a transition.
